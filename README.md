# 🧠 Flutter Design Patterns

A curated collection of common **Design Patterns** implemented in **Flutter**. This repository demonstrates how to apply popular software architecture and design principles to real-world Flutter applications, helping developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

---

## 📦 Repository Structure

Each design pattern is contained in its own directory with a clear structure:

lib/
├── behavioral/
├── creational/
└── structural/

- **Behavioral Patterns** – Concerned with communication between objects.
- **Creational Patterns** – Deal with object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural Patterns** – Concerned with how classes and objects are composed.

Each pattern folder includes:
- ✅ A brief description of the pattern
- 🧪 A working Flutter example
- 📄 Inline comments for explanation
